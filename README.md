# BlazorXmlEditor

A tag-view-style xml editor for dotnet blazor webassembly

> This is a port of the xml-editor for dotnet WinForms, which was created 2006 for the Windows version of the [GaitoBotEditor](https://www.gaitobot.de).
> The project is currently under revision to remove old issues from 2006. Therefore it still contains German source code and outdated coding paradigms.
